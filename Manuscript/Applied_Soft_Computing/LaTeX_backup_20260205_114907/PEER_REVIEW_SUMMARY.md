## ⚠️ Minor Weaknesses (Not Critical)

### 1. Convergence Analysis (Optional)
- **Issue**: Training convergence not explicitly shown
- **Impact**: Minor - reviewers may ask for it
- **Solution**: Can add during revision if requested
- **Priority**: LOW (not critical for acceptance)

### 2. Computational Cost Analysis (Optional)
- **Issue**: Training time comparison not included
- **Impact**: Minor - limits practical guidance
- **Solution**: Can add during revision if requested
- **Priority**: LOW (not critical for acceptance)

### 3. Real-World Validation (Expected)
- **Issue**: Results based on simulation only
- **Impact**: Minor - acknowledged in limitations
- **Solution**: Identified as future work (appropriate)
- **Priority**: N/A (future work)

## 🎯 Reviewer Questions You Can Answer

### Q1: Why does K=10 outperform K=30+?
✅ **Answered in Section 4.3**: Blocking vs. flexibility trade-off

### Q2: How generalizable is the capacity paradox?
✅ **Answered**: Load-dependent analysis (d = 0.28 to 412.62)

### Q3: How sensitive are results to hyperparameters?
✅ **Answered in Section 4.5**: Reward sensitivity analysis

### Q4: What about other queueing topologies?
✅ **Answered**: Discussed in limitations and future work

### Q5: Why not test in real UAM system?
✅ **Answered**: Simulation is standard first step; real-world validation is future work

### Q6: Why 500K timesteps?
⏳ **Can add**: Convergence analysis if requested during revision

### Q7: What about computational cost?
⏳ **Can add**: Training time comparison if requested during revision
