## 📋 Quick Reference

### Title
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vertical Queueing in Urban Air Mobility: A Hierarchical Capacity-Aware Approach

### Keywords (7)
Deep Reinforcement Learning, Urban Air Mobility, Queueing Theory, Vertical Layering, Capacity-Aware Control, Multi-Objective Optimization, Hierarchical Architecture

### Highlights (5)
1. DRL achieves 59.9% improvement over heuristics in vertical queueing
2. Inverted pyramid structure outperforms pyramid by 9.7%-19.7%
3. Lower capacity (K=10) outperforms higher (K=30) under extreme load
4. 29-dimensional state space achieves 21% better performance than 15D
5. Capacity-aware action clipping essential: 66% degradation without it
