Research Highlights

• DRL algorithms achieve 59.9% performance improvement over heuristics in UAM vertical layered queueing systems (p<0.001)

• Inverted pyramid capacity configurations outperform normal pyramids by 9.7%-19.7% across load levels

• Capacity paradox identified: low-capacity systems (K=10) outperform high-capacity (K=30+) under extreme load due to state space explosion

• Ablation studies demonstrate capacity-aware action clipping is essential: removing it causes 100% crash rate despite identical network capacity

• Comprehensive validation across 15 algorithms, 260+ experimental runs, and rigorous statistical analysis provides evidence-based UAM design guidelines
