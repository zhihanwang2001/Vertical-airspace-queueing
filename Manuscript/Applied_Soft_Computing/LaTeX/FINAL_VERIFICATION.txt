NARRATIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK
=================================================================

✅ Core Message:
"HCA2C's performance stems from TWO factors:
1. Increased network capacity (821K vs 85K)
2. Architectural design (capacity-aware clipping)

Ablation proves: Removing capacity-aware clipping → 100% crash
Therefore: Architecture is critical, not just parameters"

✅ Key Numbers Consistency:
- HCA2C-Full: 228,945 ± 170 (CV 0.07%) ✓
- HCA2C-Wide: -366 ± 1 (100% crash) ✓
- A2C-Baseline: 85,650 ✓
- Performance improvement: 167% ✓
- Parameters: HCA2C 821K, A2C 85K ✓

✅ Cross-References:

SERVER EXPERIMENTS STATUS
=================================================================

Progress: 22/45 (49%)
ETA: 2026-01-30 3am (~54 hours)
Decision: NOT using this data (unfair training steps)
Reason: HCA2C 500K vs A2C/PPO 100K steps

SUMMARY
=================================================================

The ablation study has been successfully integrated into the 
manuscript. All planned modifications are complete, all numbers 
are consistent, and the PDF compiles without errors.

The narrative clearly states that HCA2C's advantage comes from 
BOTH increased capacity AND architectural design, with the 
ablation study proving that capacity-aware clipping is essential 
(100% crash without it).

This approach:
- Is honest about parameter advantage
- Provides rigorous ablation validation
- Avoids fairness controversies
- Strengthens the paper's contribution

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE AND READY
