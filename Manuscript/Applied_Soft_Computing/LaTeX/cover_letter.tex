\opening{Dear Editor,}

We submit our manuscript titled \textbf{"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vertical Layered Queueing Systems in Urban Air Mobility: A Comparative Study of 15 Algorithms"} for consideration in \textit{Applied Soft Computing}.

\textbf{Research Contribution:}

This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for vertical layered queueing systems in Urban Air Mobility contexts. Through systematic experimentation with 15 state-of-the-art algorithms across 500,000 timesteps and rigorous statistical validation, we establish three principal contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Algorithm Performance:} We demonstrate that DRL algorithms achieve 59.9\% performance improvement over traditional heuristic methods, with A2C emerging as the optimal choice for production deployment (4437.86 reward, 6.9 minutes training time).

\item \textbf{Structural Design Principles:} We identify and validate the capacity-flow matching principle, showing that inverted pyramid configurations consistently outperform normal pyramid structures by 9.7\%-19.7\% across load conditions, providing direct design guidelines for UAM infrastructure planning.

\item \textbf{Capacity Paradox Discovery:} We discover and validate a counter-intuitive capacity paradox where low-capacity systems (K=10) outperform high-capacity systems (K=30+) by orders of magnitude under extreme load conditions, challenging conventional capacity planning assumptions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Significance and Novelty:}

This research addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing the first systematic comparison of DRL algorithms for vertical queueing systems in UAM contexts. Our findings advance both theoretical understanding of DRL applications in operations research and provide actionable insights for UAM system designers. The demonstrated robustness across heterogeneous traffic patterns and insensitivity to reward function specifications establishes confidence for practical deployment.

\textbf{Fit with Applied Soft Computing:}

This manuscript aligns perfectly with the scope of \textit{Applied Soft Computing}, which publishes research on soft computing techniques applied to real-world problems. Our work combines deep reinforcement learning (a core soft computing technique) with operations research applications in emerging urban air mobility systems, demonstrating both theoretical advances and practical applicability.
